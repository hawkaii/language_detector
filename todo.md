Assignment: Building a Language Detective Service for Audio
Goal
Build a service that detects the spoken language in an audio file by integrating
with multiple AI providers.
Core Requirements
1. Provider Connectors
Create separate Python functions (connectors) for these 4 providers:
OpenAI
Google Gemini
Sarvam AI
ElevenLabs
Each connector:
Accepts an audio file path.

Returns a language code (e.g., "en" , "hi" , "ta" ).
Handles errors without crashing.
At least 2 connectors must be fully implemented (real API calls); the
other 2 can return fixed mock responses.
2. Coordinator Function
Orchestrates calls to all 4 connectors for a given file.
For each provider, record:
Provider name
Detected language
Time taken (seconds)
Estimated cost (tokens and dollar usage per provider)
Status ( success , failure , error )
Error message, if any

3. API Endpoint
Implement a FastAPI POST /detect/language endpoint.
Request: JSON with audio_file_path and ground_truth_language (for context only).
Response: JSON list of results from all 4 providers, with details above.

Deliverables
Python codebase with separate modules for connectors, coordinator, and API.
Working integration for at least 2 real providers.
Robust handling of API/network errors.
Evaluation
Accuracy of detection for implemented providers.
Proper reporting of timing, cost, status, and errors.
Bonus point for accuracy with indian languages.
